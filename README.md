The addup.html page is to be done my Anmol,
the "Get Started" button should redirect the page to the first page, i.e. "OverAll Student Performace Analysis"



Also, what Apeksha said earlier regarding all the tables being in the same page, ig it'll be a problem as we don't know 
how to dynamically update the page.
Thus, 8 semesters will have 8 pages(2 graphs for each semester), can't help it. It is what it is.



Now I want Akshay's code so that I can use it in s1.html and along with the table and can show the graph(s).
