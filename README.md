The addup.html and addmarks.html page is to be done my Anmol,
the "Get Started" (addup) and "Submit"(addmarks) button should redirect the page to the first page, i.e. "OverAll Student Performace Analysis"



Also, what Apeksha, you just adjust the graph position, that part I could'nt do.
Thus, 8 semesters will have 8 pages(2 graphs for each semester)



Now I want Akshay's code so that I can use it in s1.html and along with the table and can show the graph(s).
